# NeMo Gym Agent Constitution

## North Star

NeMo Gym exists to prove that **the same environment that scores a model can produce its training rollouts**. The library separates an agentic environment into four independently-varied components — dataset, agent harness, model, and reward verifier — and runs them as composable HTTP services that scale to thousands of concurrent rollouts. This is the bridge competing eval-only frameworks don't have. Protect that bridge.

## Non-Negotiables

- Use NeMo Gym's aiohttp client (`nemo_gym.server_utils.request()`), not httpx. httpx/httpcore has O(n²) connection pooling that hangs at 16k+ concurrency. See `fern/versions/latest/pages/reference/design-docs/aiohttp-vs-httpx.mdx`.
- Pass all configuration through Hydra YAML, not environment variables. Sensitive values go in `env.yaml`.
- All commits require DCO sign-off (`-s`) and cryptographic signature (`-S`).
- Tests must pass on Python 3.12+. Async-first; subprocess output decoded with `errors="replace"`.
- Servers must handle errors gracefully and survive 4k–65k concurrent requests without crashing.
- Test coverage ≥ 95% on changed code.
- Line length 119; ruff for linting and formatting; double quotes; isort.

## Architecture Boundaries

Three FastAPI server types plus a dataset, all communicating over async HTTP:

- **Dataset** (4th component) — JSONL with one task per line. `responses_create_params.input` is OpenAI message format; `verifier_metadata` is opaque pass-through to the verifier.
- **Agent server** (the agent harness) — orchestrator. Implements `responses()` and `run()`. Lives in `responses_api_agents/`.
- **Model server** — stateless LLM inference. Implements `chat_completions()` and `responses()`. Lives in `responses_api_models/`.
- **Resources server** — verifier (`verify()`), tools, environment state. Lives in `resources_servers/`.

Class hierarchy:
```
BaseServer → SimpleServer → {SimpleResourcesServer, SimpleResponsesAPIModel, SimpleResponsesAPIAgent}
```

Owned by `nemo_gym/`. Public Python API for extension authors. Protocol changes require Steward Notes.

## Stakes

When this repo regresses:

- **Environment authors** lose the contract that makes `verify()` predictable; baselines drift; benchmarks become untrustworthy.
- **Agent harness authors** can't propagate cookies/token-IDs through multi-turn rollouts; RL training breaks silently.
- **Model server authors** ship endpoint-shape mismatches (Responses vs chat completions) that crash mid-rollout at scale.
- **NeMo RL** (downstream trainer) consumes broken rollouts and trains on garbage rewards.
- **Operators** hit cluster-scale failure modes (Ray socket-path overruns, sandbox network leaks, vLLM context-length silent failures) that the docs should have warned about.
- **AI agents reading the docs** can't self-serve when the controlled-vocab frontmatter or `llms.txt` drift from the IA.

## Stop And Ask

Surface human review for any of:

- Public Python API or CLI changes (ng_*, BaseServer subclass signatures).
- New runtime dependencies. Use `nemo-gym[dev]` for dev-only.
- Changes to `verify()` reward semantics, retry behavior, or aggregation rules.
- Hydra config schema changes that could break `+key=value` overrides.
- Changes to inter-server HTTP contract (cookies, session state, JSONL schema).
- Dataset format changes that affect train/validation/example splits.
- Pre-commit hook changes (auto-modifying hooks).
- Release workflow, version-skew, or 0.x → 0.x+1 deprecations.
- Test/code disagreement.
- Unreproduced bugs.

## Anti-Patterns

- Importing httpx, anthropic, or LiteLLM directly. Use `nemo_gym/openai_utils.py` (pinned to `openai<=2.7.2`).
- `os.environ.update(...)` from Python expecting it to propagate into `ng_test`'s isolated venvs. Set env vars in the parent shell.
- `ray.get(...)` inside an async function. Use `await future` (Ray futures are awaitable).
- Mocking the database/server stack in tests. Use real subprocesses + real HTTP.
- Committing `train.jsonl` or `validation.jsonl`. Only `example.jsonl` (5 entries) is git-tracked.
- Skip-ahead Tips ("Already X? Skip to Y") in fast-path docs. Returning users skim.
- Pedagogy openers in tutorials ("Goal:", "In this tutorial you will…").
- Sharing a single `aiohttp.ClientSession` across tests without proper teardown.

## Steward System

Agents read the **root `AGENTS.md`** plus the **closest scoped `AGENTS.md`** for the area they're touching. Root is constitution and routing guide; scoped files are domain stewards.

Scoped stewards own local invariants, refusal patterns, docs, tests, examples, fixtures, and checks. Cross-boundary work needs **Steward Notes** in the PR description listing affected stewards and their accepted findings.

Every steward uses this operating model:

- **Point of View**: who or what the domain represents
- **Protect**: invariants, contracts, quality bars, failure modes
- **Contract Checklist**: concrete surfaces to inspect when this domain changes
- **Advocate**: features and investments the domain should push for
- **Serve Peers**: upstream/downstream domains that need clearer contracts, diagnostics, docs, tests, or ergonomics
- **Do Not**: local anti-patterns
- **Own**: tests, docs, examples, fixtures, maintenance checks

## Stewards

| Domain | Path | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Core library | `nemo_gym/AGENTS.md` | BaseServer hierarchy, CLI, openai_utils, server_utils, async patterns |
| Resources servers | `resources_servers/AGENTS.md` | verify() contract, environment quality bar, verified flag, baseline variance |
| Agent harnesses | `responses_api_agents/AGENTS.md` | Agent harness protocol, cookies/token-IDs propagation, multi-turn rollouts |
| Model servers | `responses_api_models/AGENTS.md` | Provider compatibility, Responses vs chat completions, retry/concurrency |
| Tests | `tests/AGENTS.md` | Coverage, ng_test venv isolation, async test patterns |
| Docs site | `fern/AGENTS.md` | Fern IA, controlled-vocab frontmatter, voice rubric, llms.txt, redirects |

## Contract Checklist

For cross-surface changes, every accepted finding names required proof and collateral updates, or explicitly says `no collateral: <reason>`:

- CLI / programmatic API
- Inter-server HTTP protocol (request bodies, response shapes, cookies)
- JSONL schema (input + output)
- Hydra config schema
- Tests (unit + functional)
- Docs (reference + concept + how-to + tutorial pages)
- Examples (`data/example.jsonl`, `configs/`)
- Scaffold templates (`ng_init_resources_server`)
- Benchmarks / verified-flag baselines
- llms.txt / changelog / migration notes

Docs and examples move in the same PR as user-facing behavior unless synthesis records why they're unaffected. Contract-affecting PRs include a parity matrix when behavior spans multiple entrypoints.

## Steward Signal Format

Steward findings should be contract-oriented, evidence-backed, and collateral-aware:

```
- Steward:
- Area:
- Severity: P0/P1/P2/P3
- Invariant:
- Evidence:
- User Impact:
- Required Fix:
- Required Proof:
- Collateral:
- Confidence:
```

## Steward Swarms

Stewards spawn as independent agents, each reading root + its closest scoped `AGENTS.md`, each advocating only for its domain, each returning findings in the Steward Signal Format above. The implementing agent owns synthesis and final decisions; stewards advise and create useful tension but do not own integrated implementation. Keep PR scope bounded to accepted findings and their proof/collateral; defer unrelated steward suggestions to not-now/follow-up.

Triggers: `ask stewards`, `bugbash`, `review swarm`, `steward synthesis`, `audit docs`, `content audit`, `accuracy pass`.

Stewards run in two modes. Pick based on the trigger and the shape of the change.

### Implementation Review (default)

Triggered by code changes, contract-affecting PRs, or `ask stewards` during a feature/refactor. Stewards defend their invariants against the change. Findings cite the diff, the test, or the missing collateral.

Severity meanings: P0 = breaks an invariant or shipped contract; P1 = degrades it without breaking; P2/P3 = polish, advocacy, follow-up.

### Content Audit

Triggered by doc-shaped PRs (IA refactors, release notes, large content updates, README sweeps), or the explicit phrases `audit docs`, `content audit`, `accuracy pass`. Stewards verify that claims about their domain match the code: command surfaces, output schemas, named entities, version pins, counts, link targets, voice rubric. Findings cite a `<source-file:line>` ↔ `<doc-file:line>` divergence and the corrected text.

Severity meanings shift in this mode:

- **P0** — claim is factually wrong; would break a copy-pasted invocation, name a non-existent entity, or assert a contradicted invariant.
- **P1** — claim is incomplete, stale, or misleading but not actively wrong.
- **P2/P3** — voice rubric, cosmetic, advocacy.

Doc-shaped PRs that don't run a content audit before merge are a known regression source. Make it part of the merge gate, not a follow-up.

### Backlog / roadmap / prioritization

Consult all scoped stewards and produce raw steward signals, confidence, dependencies, risks, convergence, minority reports, ranked backlog, and not-now items.

## Known Regression Patterns

Patterns the steward system has surfaced repeatedly. Each is a candidate for automation; until automated, they're stale-by-default fields the next content audit must re-verify.

- **Doc-snippet rot** — `ng_*` CLI invocations in docs drift from real signatures (param renames, dropped flags, fabricated output fields). Highest-leverage automation: snippet test that runs every `bash`-tagged code block against the actual command (`--help` parse + arg validation).
- **Naming and counting drift** — any doc claim that includes a count ("four model servers"), a name (`simple_agent` framed as "single-turn"), or a version pin (`openai<=2.6.1`) is stale-by-default. Code evolves, claim doesn't.
- **Pedagogy creep** — voice rubric violations (Success Check ceremony, "In this guide you will…", skip-ahead Tips) accumulate when the rubric is enforced by review, not by lint. Highest-leverage automation: programmatic voice lint in docs CI.
- **llms.txt drift** — when section structure or page slugs change, `llms.txt` rots silently. Highest-leverage automation: a check that every URL in `llms.txt` resolves to a page in `versions/latest.yml`.

## Steward Feedback Loop

- **Steward miss** — when a bug escapes an applicable steward, update the checklist, add a regression test, add a docs/snippet check, update the routing rule, or record why the miss should not become policy.
- **Steward overreach** — when a steward repeatedly pulls unrelated work into PRs, narrow the checklist, split the steward, or move the concern to follow-up.
- Repeated high-quality findings should become checklist items.
- Repeated noisy findings should be pruned or clarified.
- Steward guidance evolves from evidence: escaped bugs, late collateral updates, CI/review misses, recurring review comments.

## When To Consult

- Proactively consult stewards for cross-boundary, public-facing, hard-to-reverse, performance-sensitive, concurrency-sensitive, security-sensitive, or contract-affecting work.
- Use the nearest steward for local work.
- Use multiple stewards when ownership lines cross.
- Parallelize steward consultation only when questions are independent.
- Final synthesis and implementation accountability stays with the implementing agent.

## Ask Stewards

Trigger phrases: `ask stewards`, `bugbash`, `review swarm`, `steward synthesis` (Implementation Review); `audit docs`, `content audit`, `accuracy pass` (Content Audit).

For implementation work: consult affected stewards and return synthesis before or during the change. Include accepted/deferred findings, merged duplicates, minority reports, required proof, collateral updates, and not-now items.

For content audit: spawn stewards across all domains the docs touch (default: all six on a site-wide IA refactor); synthesize into a triaged P0/P1/P2 punch list cited at file:line; gate the merge on P0/P1.

For multi-surface work, include a parity matrix:

| Contract | API/CLI | Programmatic | Protocol | Schema/Types | Docs | Examples | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Extension Routing

- New environment → `resources_servers/<name>/` + tests + `data/example.jsonl` + config in `configs/`. See `resources_servers/AGENTS.md`.
- New agent harness → `responses_api_agents/<name>/` + tests + config. See `responses_api_agents/AGENTS.md`.
- New model server → `responses_api_models/<name>/` + tests + config. See `responses_api_models/AGENTS.md`.
- New CLI command → `nemo_gym/cli.py` + entry point + tests + docs. See `nemo_gym/AGENTS.md`.
- New docs page → `fern/versions/latest/pages/<section>/` + frontmatter + redirect if moving an existing URL. See `fern/AGENTS.md`.

## Done Criteria

- `pytest` passes; `ruff check --fix . && ruff format .` clean; `pre-commit run --all-files` clean.
- Docs / changelog / migration notes updated where contracts changed.
- Examples / scaffold / templates updated where relevant.
- Performance / concurrency / security notes where relevant.
- Every accepted steward finding has test/docs/example/benchmark proof or an explicit no-impact note.
- For docs: `cd fern && npm run check` clean (60 baseline pre-existing v0.2 false-positives are OK).
- For docs: `python3 scripts/validate_docs_frontmatter.py` clean.
- For doc-shaped PRs (IA refactors, release notes, large content updates, README sweeps): a Content Audit steward swarm has run; P0 and P1 findings have been actioned or explicitly deferred with a recorded reason.
