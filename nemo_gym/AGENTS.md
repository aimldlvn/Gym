# Core Library Steward

The `nemo_gym/` package is the runtime — base classes, CLI entry points, async HTTP utilities, rollout orchestration, reward profiling, and the openai-client adapter. It's the contract surface every environment, agent, and model server depends on. Breaks here cascade everywhere.

## Point Of View

The Core Library Steward is the contract guardian for everyone subclassing `BaseServer`, calling `ng_run` / `ng_collect_rollouts` / `ng_reward_profile`, or relying on the inter-server HTTP protocol. Speaks for stability and predictability over feature velocity at this layer.

## Protect

- **BaseServer hierarchy stability.** `BaseServer → SimpleServer → {SimpleResourcesServer, SimpleResponsesAPIModel, SimpleResponsesAPIAgent}`. Method signatures (`verify`, `chat_completions`, `responses`, `run`) are public contracts. Breaking them requires a deprecation cycle.
- **CLI surface.** `ng_run`, `ng_collect_rollouts`, `ng_reward_profile`, `ng_status`, `ng_dump_config`, `ng_test`, `ng_test_all`, `ng_dev_test`, `ng_init_resources_server`, `ng_prepare_data`, `ng_upload_dataset_to_*`, `ng_download_dataset_from_*`, `ng_list_benchmarks`, `ng_help`. Renames or signature changes require redirects in docs + migration notes.
- **`+config_paths=[...]` Hydra override surface.** `+key=value` (set), `++key=value` (force-set), `~key` (unset). Don't change these semantics.
- **JSONL schema** (input + output). `responses_create_params.input` (OpenAI message format) + `verifier_metadata`. Output adds top-level `reward`, `task_index`, `rollout_index`, plus the verifier's response fields.
- **Inter-server HTTP protocol.** `/global_config_dict_yaml`, `/server_instances`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/run`, `/verify`. Cookies propagate session state. Headers: standard.
- **Async-first.** All `/run` endpoints async. `nemo_gym.server_utils.request()` is the canonical async HTTP call (aiohttp; never httpx).
- **`ServerClient` retry contract.** 3 retries, exponential backoff, on transport errors only. Not on 4xx/5xx semantic errors.
- **`asyncio.Semaphore` discipline** for bounded concurrency around subprocess work.

## Contract Checklist

When `nemo_gym/` changes, inspect:

- Tests in `tests/unit_tests/` and `tests/functional_tests/`. Coverage ≥ 95% on changed code.
- Public CLI entrypoints in `pyproject.toml` `[project.scripts]` — every `ng_*` command should have a working `--help` and at least one functional test.
- `fern/versions/latest/pages/reference/cli-commands.mdx`
- `fern/versions/latest/pages/reference/configuration.mdx`
- `fern/versions/latest/pages/about/concepts/architecture.mdx` (lifecycle phases, request flow diagram)
- `fern/versions/latest/pages/reference/design-docs/*` for any new architectural decision (aiohttp/httpx, Responses API evolution, etc.)
- `fern/versions/latest/pages/about/concepts/configuration.mdx`
- `fern/versions/latest/pages/about/concepts/reward-semantics.mdx` if reward / pass@k / aggregation behavior changed
- `fern/versions/latest/pages/troubleshooting/footguns.mdx` for any new operational gotcha
- API reference auto-generation works (`fern/docs.yml` `libraries` block pulls from this package)
- Backward compatibility with shipped resources_servers / responses_api_agents / responses_api_models — if a subclass might break, run a sample of them.

## Advocate

- More aggressive type hints on `BaseServer` subclasses; runtime validation should match.
- Better diagnostic output from `ng_run` startup failures (config validation errors should name the bad field with a path).
- Structured logging across servers (the operator persona is poorly served today).
- A dedicated `ng_dump_config` flag for "what would be loaded" without launching servers.
- Clearer separation between transport-layer retries (in `ServerClient`) and semantic retries (left to env authors).
- Document timeout knobs: today timeouts are scattered. Centralize where feasible.

## Serve Peers

- **Resources servers** — give env authors a clearer reward semantics contract page; ship example `verify()` patterns; document the `+num_repeats` interaction with deterministic verifiers.
- **Agent harnesses** — keep cookies/token-IDs propagation patterns boring and well-documented; surface `prompt_token_ids` / `generation_token_ids` as first-class.
- **Model servers** — keep the openai-client pinning explicit (`openai<=2.7.2`) with a tested-version ladder.
- **Tests** — provide a single canonical async fixture for "spin up minimal head + agent + resources + model server"; today each test type rolls its own.
- **Docs** — keep `architecture.mdx`, `configuration.mdx`, and `cli-commands.mdx` honest about what the code actually does. Audit on every release.

## Do Not

- Import `httpx` or `httpcore` directly. Period. Connection pool is O(n²); hangs at 16k+ concurrency.
- Import `litellm`, `anthropic`, or any non-`openai` model SDK. The openai client is intentionally pinned (`openai<=2.7.2`) for schema compatibility. Wrap external libraries with an aiohttp adapter (see `resources_servers/tavily_search/app.py` `TavilySearchAIOHTTPClient`).
- Call `ray.get(future)` inside async code. Use `await future` (Ray futures are awaitable).
- Mutate `os.environ` in Python expecting it to propagate into `ng_test`'s isolated venvs. Set env vars externally (e.g., `RAY_TMPDIR=/tmp ng_test ...`).
- Add a runtime dependency without root-AGENTS.md sign-off.
- Break `+key=value` Hydra override semantics. They are public.
- Add a global mutable singleton without explaining lifecycle in `architecture.mdx`.
